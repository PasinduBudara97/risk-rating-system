multi class neural network----------create a neural network model that can be used to predict a target that has multiple values.


one class svm ---------------- Creates a one class Support Vector Machine model for anomaly detection///////////// This module is particularly
						 useful in scenarios where you have a lot of "normal" data and not many cases of 
						the anomalies you are trying to detect. For example, if you need to detect fraudulent transactions, you might not have many examples of
 						fraud that you could use to train a typical classification model, but you might have many examples of good transactions.




poision regression-------------Poisson regression is intended for use in regression models that are used to predict numeric values, typically counts.

 
two class registic(logistic) regression-------- create a logistic regression model that can be used to predict two (and only two) outcomes.

						Logistic regression is a well-known statistical technique that is used for modeling many kinds of problems. This algorithm is a supervised learning method; therefore, you must provide a dataset that already contains the outcomes to train the model.
